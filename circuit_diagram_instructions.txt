## Ultrasonic Sensor Explanation
The ultrasonic sensor uses the `TRIG` and `ECHO` pins to measure distance. The `TRIG` pin sends out a pulse, and the `ECHO` pin receives the reflected pulse. The time taken for the pulse to return is used to calculate the distance to an object.

## Servo Motor and Gripper Mechanism
The servo motor is connected to the gripper mechanism. It controls the opening and closing of the gripper to pick up and place objects. The servo is initially set to 90 degrees (open position) and moves to 0 degrees to close the gripper.

## Robot Functionality
The robot follows a specific path using IR sensors. It detects objects using the ultrasonic sensor and picks them up with the gripper mechanism. The robot then moves to a designated box and places the object there. The path and robot structure are illustrated in the images `path.jpg`, `gripper.jpg`, and `robot.jpg` in the repository.
